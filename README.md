# js-library-daveaadi

## Getting Started

To get started on using the library, you will first need to add the following script and stylesheet references to your webpage since SimpleForms.js does not rely on any other library.

```html
<script src="simple-forms.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="simple-forms.css">
```
